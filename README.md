Experiment with Deep Residual Convolutional Neural Network to classify microscopic blood cell images (Uninfected, Parasitized)
Utiling ResNet,Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (He et al, 2015) architecture. 
Uses Keras with a Tensorflow backend. 
We varied the model parameters to observe the effects on performance of on the result
The model achieved an verall training accuracy is 97%
